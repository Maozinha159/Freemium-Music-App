            So I recently found a vulnerability in Saavn Rest API which enables you to access premium content directly. 
So I decided why not make an app so that everyone can enjoy it.... and this app is the result.

### Things to consider:

* This App is developed Lollipop (API level 22) as the base, so it should work flawlessly on Marshmallow and above devices.
* However, ID3 tagging and Album art feature are currently enabled for only for devices with Android Oreo(Api 26) and Above.
* Downloads page is still under development and will be released in next beta...

### What about next release?
* Will include an online streaming feature within the app.
* Revamp the downloads page.
* Make the app more Smoother
